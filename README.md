# ezPOC8
POCSAG transmitter by DO4LR

This is the repository of my developed POCSAG transmitter for multi-purpose use. You can use it with ezPAGE to connect it to the DAPNET (more information in its own folder), embedd it to a project or many other uses. Not just the software is opensource, also the Hardware for the transmitter itself. With a Poweramplifier it a full-scale basestation transmitter.

The POCSAG generating library is based on ON1ARFs, but modified. You can generate up to 76 characters per POCSAG message (depending on RIC). 

ezPOC8 can be connected via USB or TTL UART.

The best: it can be build under 20â‚¬!
